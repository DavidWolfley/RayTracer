# RayTracer
This project is a recreation of the ray tracer created by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch as displayed in Ray Tracing in One Weekend, which can be found here: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html /n
There are adjustments in order to allow for output on Windows devices, such as changes to file output.
